# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 20 , 2022 Monday

- Work done : I continued freecode camp : responsive web design course - I have worked on it for a week or so.  I have realised the basic tribute page. It was a test. In plain HTML and CSS and without no frameworks. Must improve the responsiveness of the page. And fix the padding & margins of the page.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
